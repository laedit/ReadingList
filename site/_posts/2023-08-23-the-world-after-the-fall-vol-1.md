![Couverture](/img/9798400900044.jpg)One day, without warning, gargantuan towers appear around the globe. Humanity’s surprise and puzzlement soon turn to panic and terror, as swarms of horrific monsters descend upon the world to wreak havoc. Mankind’s only hope for survival rests on Jaehwan and his fellow Tower Walkers, who are tasked with one mission—Climb to the top.

…Or so they believed. Jaehwan begins to sense that things are not what they seem, and he must trust no one but himself. As webs of deception threaten to ensnare him at every turn, can Jaehwan reach Floor 100 and finally uncover the truth?
