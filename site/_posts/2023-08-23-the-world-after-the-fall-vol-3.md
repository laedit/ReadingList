![Couverture](/img/9798400900396.jpg)As he scrambles to save Mino’s deteriorating soul, Jaehwan is suddenly transported to a strange dimension. There, he faces a mysterious old man who wields a power similar to his own-the power of Awakening! His interest is piqued when the ancient warrior claims to have known the Dream Demon Mulak, the cryptic architect of the Nightmare Tower that appeared on Earth! But before the man can tell the full story, an aura of bottomless dread descends upon the fortress. Something has awakened, something that whispers death and despair. For the first time ever, Jaehwan must fight with his full strength if he is to survive the impending doom…
