![Couverture](/img/9798400900945.webp)Grid decides to help protect old man Khan’s smithy from Mero Company for the sake of justice and the greater good… but mostly for the priceless sword and armor once worn by Pagma himself! But as usual, he’s bitten off more than he can chew and finds out the hard way that his opponent is wealthy and well-connected and has no intention of playing fair. Entrapped by their scheme and forced into impossible odds, Grid will need the help of some unexpected allies and overpowered items!
