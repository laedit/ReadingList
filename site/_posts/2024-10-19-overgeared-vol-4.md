![Couverture](/img/9798400901652.webp)Things are finally looking up for Grid. He’s gained more levels and stats, as well as combat experience…but most importantly, overpowered items! With a stacked inventory, he’s ready to take on Kesan Gorge to complete his class quest. Before he can discover Pagma’s fabled Sword Dance, however, he runs into some old bullies from high school. But they’re not dealing with the loser Youngwoo Shin anymore—they’re up against Grid, the Legendary Blacksmith!
