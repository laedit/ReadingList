![Couverture](/img/9798400902185.webp)The Earl Steim’s daughter, Irene is quite smitten with Grid following his recent heroics, and he’s first in line for her hand in marriage! He finally has a chance to gain what he’s been searching for all his life—love...and more importantly, the sweet tax money from becoming the lord of Winston! Before he can tie the knot, however, Grid has to take care of some unfinished business, like recovering his Legendary-Class shield that was stolen...but is he ready to take on an entire religion to get it back?
