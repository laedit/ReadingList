![Couverture](/img/9798400903717.webp)Skills, power, prestige—Gongja’s got things he could only dream of in the previous timeline. None of that, however, comes close to the recognition of the great five guild leaders as well as the tentative trust of the strongest hunter in the Tower—all of them people who, despite their constant bickering, clearly care deeply about their fellow hunters and without whom society would crumble. That’s why Gongja’s determined to ensure their safety by singlehandedly paving the way to the twentieth floor. After all, what’s a few revivals when the future of humanity is at stake?
