Ares and Theodora have landed in Zoltan, ready to bring the Hero back to fulfill their destinies! Meanwhile, Red, Rit, and Tisse head to the ancient elven ruins to confront Godwin and find a way to save Ruti from her blessing. As the former members of the Hero’s party cross paths once again, will it be duty or freedom that wins in the end? Or is there something more sinister at play?!
